By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more. The Role Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organisations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer Intern, you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, or Palantir Apollo: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organisation is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. Core Responsibilities As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties. SWE principles include: • Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. • Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers.

Evals Software Engineer,apolloresearch,london,https://jobs.lever.co/apolloresearch/64a79893-84bf-4005-a762-852ee2bcccce,"Applications deadline: Our hiring cycle for Q3 has concluded for now. New applications will be considered from Oct 2025 onwards . ABOUT APOLLO RESEARCH The capabilities of current AI systems are evolving at a rapid pace. While these advancements offer tremendous opportunities, they also present significant risks, such as the potential for deliberate misuse or the deployment of sophisticated yet misaligned models. At Apollo Research , our primary concern lies with deceptive alignment, a phenomenon where a model appears to be aligned but is, in fact, misaligned and capable of evading human oversight. Our approach focuses on behavioral model evaluations, which we then use to audit real-world models. We also combine black-box approaches with applied interpretability. In our evaluations, we focus on LM agents, i.e. LLMs with agentic scaffolding similar to AIDE or SWE agent . We also study model organisms in controlled environments (see our security policies ), e.g. to better understand capabilities related to scheming. At Apollo, we aim for a culture that emphasizes truth-seeking, being goal-oriented, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and being friendly and helpful. If you’re interested in more details about what it’s like working at Apollo, you can find more information here . THE OPPORTUNITY We're seeking a Software Engineer who will enhance our capability to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) through building critical tools and libraries for our Evals team. Your work will directly impact our mission to make AI systems safer and more aligned. What You'll Accomplish in Your First Year 1. Accelerate our frontier LLM evaluations research by leading the design and implementation of software libraries and tools that underpin our end-to-end research workflows 2. Ensure the reliability of our experimental results by building tools that identify subtle changes in LLM behavior and maintain integrity across our research 3. Shape the vision for our internal software platform, leading key decisions about how researchers will run workloads, interact with data, analyze results, and share insights 4. Increase team productivity by providing design guidance, debugging, and technical support to unblock researchers and enable them to focus on their core research 5. Build expertise working with state of the art (SOTA) AI systems and tackling the unique challenges posed when building software around them Key Responsibilities - Rapidly prototype and iterate on internal tools and libraries for building and running frontier language model evaluations - Lead the development of major features from ideation to implementation - Collaboratively define and shape the software roadmap and priorities - Establish and advocate for good software design practices and codebase health - Establish design patterns for new types of evaluations - Build LLM agents that automate our internal software development and research - Work closely with researchers to understand what challenges they face - Assist researchers with implementation and debugging of research code - Communicate clearly about technical decisions and tradeoffs Job Requirements You must have experience writing production-quality python code. We are looking for strong generalist software engineers with a track record of taking ownership. Candidates may demonstrate these skills in different ways. For example, you might have one of more of these: - Led the development of a successful software tool or product over an extended period (e.g. 1 year or more) - Started and built the tech stack for a company - Worked your way up in a large organisation, repeatedly gaining more responsibility and influencing a large part of the codebase - Authored and/or maintained a popular open-source tool or library - 5+ years of professional software engineering experience The following experience would be a bonus: - Experience working with LLM agents or LLM evaluations - Infosecurity / cybersecurity experience - Experience working with AWS - Interest in AI Safety We want to emphasize that people who feel they don’t fulfill all of these characteristics but think they would be a good fit for the position nonetheless are strongly encouraged to apply . We believe that excellent candidates can come from a variety of backgrounds and are excited to give you opportunities to shine. Representative projects - Implement an internal job orchestration tool which allows researchers to run evals on remote machines. - Build out an eval runs database which stores all historical results in a queryable format. - Implement LLM agents to automate internal software engineering and research tasks. - Design and implement research tools for loading, viewing and interacting with transcripts from eval runs. - Establish internal patterns and conventions for building new types of evaluations within the Inspect framework. - Optimize the CI pipeline to reduce execution time and eliminate flaky tests. ABOUT THE TEAM The current evals team consists of Mikita Balesni , Jérémy Scheurer , Alex Meinke , Rusheb Shah , Bronson Schoen , Andrei Matveiakin, Felix Hofstätter, and Axel Højmark . MariusHobbhahn manages and advises the team, though team members lead individual projects. You would work closely with Rusheb and Andrei, who are the full-time software engineers on the evals team, but you would also interact a lot with everyone else.

The Cabinet Office then processes this data and discloses a limited dataset back to DLUHC as a participating government organisations. DLUHC then carry out the pre employment checks so as to detect instances where known fraudsters are attempting to reapply for roles in the civil service. In this way, the policy is ensured and the repetition of internal fraud is prevented.&nbsp; </span><span style=""font-size: 8pt;"">For more information please see -&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/internal-fraud-register-privacy-notice/internal-fraud-register-privacy-notice"">Internal Fraud Register.</a></span></p>

At the heart of Copper's offering is Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology – the gold standard in secure custody. Copper’s multi-award winning custody system is unique in that it can be connected to centralised exchanges, DeFi applications and even staking pools without the assets leaving the custody. </span><br><br><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"">Built on top of this state-of-the-art custody, ClearLoop is the first solution in the market that overcomes a growing industry challenge; counterparty risk with exchanges. This solution underpins a full prime services offering, connecting global exchanges, and enabling customers to trade and settle directly from the safety of their MPC-secured wallets. By reducing settlement time for transfers to a few milliseconds (without blockchain network dependency) and offering enhanced security measures, ClearLoop is rapidly reshaping the way asset managers trade and manage capital. </span><br><br><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"">In addition to industry-leading security certifications, Copper has one of the strongest insurance coverages in the industry from an A+ rated insurer, positioning the firm as the partner of choice for institutions seeking to safeguard their assets.</span></p></div><p><span style=""font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Department environment </strong></span></p>

We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll also have the opportunity to learn about other business areas. Core Responsibilities As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping, to execution and shipping, all while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties. SWE principles include: • Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter. • Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems. • Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage.

Full Stack Software Engineer - Application Development,palantir,"london, united kingdom",https://jobs.lever.co/palantir/c44510a1-9537-4c52-ae81-51546979fe47,"A World-Changing Company Palantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more. The Role Palantir Foundry is an end-to-end platform for data-driven decision-making. We're transforming the way organisations securely integrate their data, so they can then build reliable, critical applications atop that unified foundation. Our customers use Foundry to perform rich analyses that drive core operations within their organisations. They can also build sophisticated, full-fledged programs, such as common operating pictures, alert-triaging inboxes, and resource allocation planning tools driven by rich-ML models. As a Full Stack Engineer focused on application development in Foundry, you will be responsible for crafting the tools used by thousands of users to build the sophisticated applications that power their businesses. You will be architecting and developing interfaces, state management and access patterns to support data-intensive workflows that are both powerful and approachable. You may spend one day interviewing users to better understand their needs and identifying product gaps to improve. The next day, you might find yourself considering that customer context along with signal gathered from other customers in different industries, brainstorming approaches to handling intricate UX needs with your teammates. You’ll regularly be faced with sophisticated technical problems, requiring you to scope out the solution design and finding an incremental path to shipping the new features. As part of this, you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code, or work with other backend engineers in developing them together. We're hiring engineers who are passionate about solving real-world problems and empowering both customer app builders and end-users to do their work optimally. Below are some examples of the types of product work you’d get to do in this role: Frontline Foundry Software Engineers may be offered the opportunity to Frontline, an exclusive program unlike any other. This unique, short-term assignment involves being embedded with customers, allowing you to work directly with users and gain firsthand insight into how our products are used and the challenges our customers face. Unlike traditional engineering roles, Frontline immerses you in complex, ambiguous problems, empowering you to deliver impactful solutions across some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. Some of our most successful products were built on the factory floor, addressing real-world problems for the world's most important institutions. These products were developed by some of our most successful product engineers, who began their careers in roles aligned with Frontline responsibilities, gaining a deep understanding of both our technology and our customers. Frontliners operate across a broad spectrum of responsibilities, much like a startup CTO. They work in small teams to own the end-to-end execution of high-stakes projects. This spectrum ranges from discussing architecture and building custom web apps to conducting workshops with users and strategizing with customer executives. No two days are alike, as each day is diverse and impactful. By witnessing how customers engage with Foundry and experiencing these pain points firsthand, you’ll gain unique insights that feed directly back into our development process, helping to refine and enhance our products. After your frontline rotation is complete, you will return to your regular role where you can apply the experience and understanding you’ve gained.",['r']

ML Performance Engineer,xtxmarketstechnologies,"london, england, united kingdom",https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/xtxmarketstechnologies/jobs/5901218003,"<p><strong>The Firm</strong></p>
<p>XTX Markets is a leading algorithmic trading firm which uses state-of-the-art machine learning technology to produce price forecasts for over 50,000 financial instruments across equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and crypto. It uses those forecasts to trade on exchanges and alternative trading venues, and to offer differentiated liquidity directly to clients worldwide. The firm trades over $250bn a day across 35 countries and has over 250 employees based in London, Singapore, New York, Paris, Bristol, Mumbai and Yerevan.</p>
<p>We leverage the talent of the people who work here, modern computational techniques and state-of-the-art research infrastructure to analyse large data sets across markets quickly and efficiently, to maximize the effectiveness of our proprietary trading algorithms. We are actively seeking new methods and ideas. The models that drive our trading strategies have evolved considerably over the last 10 years, from econometric methods that gave our company its name, to trees, to neural networks, to modern deep learning architectures.</p>
<p>XTX Markets has an unrivalled level of computational resources in the trading industry, with a growing research cluster currently containing over 25,000 GPUs with 650 petabytes of usable storage. Teams across the firm include world-class researchers with backgrounds in pure math, programming, physics, computer science and machine learning. The firm is also constructing a large-scale data centre in Finland to future-proof its significant computational capabilities.</p>
<p>At XTX Markets technology is our business and we are a diverse organization which attracts outstanding talent from across all industry backgrounds. We are focused on teamwork and our people collaborate on all aspects of the business, working openly and with respect for each other, our clients and the market. Our culture is non-hierarchical and one where everyone is valued. We strive for excellence in everything we do.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p><strong>The Role </strong></p>
<p>XTX is seeking an experienced engineer to support our Research Technology function. You will be working in a small and highly technical team at an extremely low-level to dramatically increase the performance of XTX’s machine learning training and inference. Your main focus will be on accelerating computation and networking; however, the remit is wide, and you should expect to be challenged.</p>
<p>We are not just writing CUDA code. You will be expected to push hardware beyond what the manufacturer thinks is achievable. Manufacturers will tell you things are impossible or just plain absurd and you will achieve it anyway.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, you will be working on a sophisticated optimising compiler to create optimal execution plans mapping complex computational graphs to a variety of accelerated computing platforms taking both high-level (for example the consequences of a complex memory hierarchies) and low-level (for example microarchitectural restrictions on dispatch rates for different operation shapes) into account. This means both applying optimisations to our SSA intermediate representation as well as improving backend code generation. You will also be expected to hand-optimise real-world use cases to identify ways in which the compiler’s code generation may be improved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Attributes<br></strong></p>
<p>You will be an experienced software engineer, likely in C/C++/Rust or a similar language. You will be confident solving complex algorithmic problems.</p>
<p>In addition, the following experience would be of particular interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing Linux kernel modules or other experience in OS development.</li>
<li>Understanding of, and some experience targeting, commodity GPUs or other similar hardware.</li>
<li>Some experience working with SSA-based IRs.</li>
<li>A detailed understanding of PCI Express.</li>
<li>Experience writing drivers to interface to hardware (e.g., network cards or NVMe devices).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Onsite gym, sauna, and fitness classes at no charge.</li>
<li>Extensive medical benefits including an on-site doctor and therapist at no charge.</li>
<li>Breakfast and lunch provided daily.</li>
<li>Various supports for caregivers, including emergency dependent care.</li>
<li>Beautiful Kings Cross office: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/257888726"">https://vimeo.com/257888726</a></li>
<li>25 days paid holiday per year + statutory holiday and paid sick days.</li>
